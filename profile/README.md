## Multilane ðŸ––

Multilane makes assets interoperable without tradtional bridging. 

## Problem Statement

Right now tokens on 1 chain canâ€™t be used on another directly. If someone wantâ€™s to use their tokens on the other chain they have to bridge the tokens first and only then they can use it. Although this solution works there are couple of problem in doing this

Problems:

1. Bridging assets takes time
2. Fees are charged by the bridges every time you bridge
3. Your funds are fragmented across different chains

## Solution
User deposits their funds on 1 chain and after depositing this funds he can use this funds on any chain without bridging becuase we would be sponsoring users transaction (both ERC20 and native token).
